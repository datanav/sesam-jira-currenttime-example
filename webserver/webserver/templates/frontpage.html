    <h1>Welcome to the experimental JIRA/Currenttime checker!</h1>
    <p>
        The JIRA/Currenttime checker compares the hours logged in JIRA and CurrentTime and reports any discrepancies
        it finds.
    </p>

    <p>
        To look at the result of the checks, click on the links below (the links are not
        to actual physical files, but to a webserver that filters the results so that you only see stuff
        that is relevant to you):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="compare-totals.csv">compare-totals.csv</a>
            <div>
                This CSV-file displays the differences between the total number of hours logged in JIRA and the
                total number of hours logged in CurrentTime.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="currenttime-with-jira-keys.csv">currenttime-with-jira-keys.csv</a>
            <div>
                This CSV-file displays problems with CurrentTime entries that refer to JIRA-issues in
                the "Note" field.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The CSV-files are updated roughly every 5 minutes. Some changes will take longer to appear:<br />
        New JIRA-tasks takes roughly an hour to appear.<br />
        CurrentTime projects, tasks and subtasks are refreshed nightly, so a new subtask will normally not  be
        available until the next day.
    </p>

    <p>
        A good way to view the CSV-files are to import them in MS Excel. You can create such a file yourself, or
        download the one below. This Excel file has two worksheets that each link to one of the CSV-files described
        above. (Use the "Data"=>"Refresh all" button in Excel to see the latest data.)
    </p>

        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
